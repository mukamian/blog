								<p>Yeah it’s true, Things not always make sense</br>
									And These are something need not be comprehended</br>
									But what to do, our heart gets stuck to that day we got hurt and I wasn’t beside</br>
									Nothing could be made it too clear and its pain can neither be hidden</br>
									Days passed and turn to years and it’s long ago</br>
									But those words you wish to tell them that time haven’t ever be known</br>
									I had written that sometime before</br>
									But now I feel words I wrote had just come and goes</br>
									Couldn’t understand why those words hurt your friendship every time spoke up</br>
									And this was…. is the only reason you never had a chance of poking them up</br>
									No matter what intention you got to tell what you feel</br>
									No matter if you never want them to rush by your side leaving people to heal</br>
									They never understand these words are not to convenience them</br>
									Never got in mind the phase they would think of them</br>
									Every time Dreaming of the day when they would be beside</br>
									Nothing happens there but they would tell about what they feel for their life</br>
									All the time you talk is about them, no matter who’s next to you</br>
									And if they say something your mind can easily be blown</br>
									This is an impression of their word which you have in your mind</br>
									You can never make them believe that you are of their kind</br>
									</p>
