								<p>Yesterday I did something to repair what I broke</br>
									But I somewhere knew you were hurt and your stand was rocked</br>
									Still, as an attempt, I thought to do was right</br>
									But still timid after that un-faced fight</br>
									The day begun with those pending how’s and why’s</br>
									I really wished one should be yours while distance races by</br>
									With don’t know how many thoughts rushed through the mind</br>
									And now stunned by the moment I find</br>
									You walked down with so much on your face</br>
									The time that moment hold slowed its a pace</br>
									I couldn’t see any crinkle by your nose and puffed cheeks</br>
									Neither you nor your eyes I feel didn’t speak</br>
									Those thoughts explanations came to a pause</br>
									I now just what to apologize for what I cause</br>
									But something holds me from coming on my knees</br>
									Ego? Not really, it was realized just as pleased</br>
									I was being guided to be stiff and frown</br>
									Asked for apologizing headed with a crown</br>
									But that crown now I realized was as false as advice</br>
									Just at the end, the thing I did, had a great price</br>
									</p>
