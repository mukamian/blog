								<p>A morning woke up with a surprise</br>
									Someone was beside wondering what a day had rise!</br>
									It seemed to be little dim so I rub my eyes</br>
									Even though if it wasn’t a reality I didn’t wanted to realize</br>
									So thought to live the moment even though lie</br>
									Uncertainty lying in my head so I peeped at side</br>
									But that someone still had no scar of tension on her face</br>
									And mine excitement had raise the pace</br>
									I decided to get up and get the things done</br>
									But a hand with a fear of left along, stops me from step one</br>
									But now the expression of her turned to mine smile</br>
									A sweet wishing made me realize the mile</br>
									She is no one still is special to me</br>
									I wish I could have be</br>
									I love to stare her and she like to be with me</br>
									Never want to express my feelings bending on my knees</br>
									And that is why our friendship is still with its feel</br>
									Now telling this people interpret a lot</br>
									But our relationship is at least above that thoughts</br>
									All these words rushed though my brain</br>
									Sudden demand of tea lead them to drain</br>
									She woke up to my side in kitchen</br>
									She ordered me list and I stood to listen</br>
									I know this would happen someday</br>
									As she had a right to all the things to say</br>
									All old day’s smell grew though our chuckles like freshly baked</br>
									Other friends were still sleeping but wake</br>
									</p>
