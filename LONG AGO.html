								<p>Just to watch her walking down with eyes on me and a smile was the one thing I was waiting for the last 15 minutes. With the sunshine reaching in the corridor we walked down along.</br>
									” Today what made you to this time”</br>
									“Aahh… Traffic”</br>
									The silence that stretched after formal know-how, was always squeezed by her.. I stood there to listen to and admiring everything about every transient expression that crosses her face. She turns pointing to a direction, reaching out to the corridor we just passed through, and told me of someone but I kept thinking “she ain’t you”</br>
									With the best timing ever someone always pokes in.. No matter when or where we have been. But Seeing her smiling, it was worth, a thing I have been struggling for and still in my thoughts I believed I’m yours</br>
									All-day long I couldn’t take my eyes off her and studies… We know how it goes. She never turns back but her friend surely did. That weird expression was all she did</br>
									Everyone around knew and so did she… Neither I had guts to tell her nor she ever yelled. I thought of being into someone who felt like that. It was not out of fear but somewhere I knew, it was us momentous and thus I don’t want it to blow</br>
									But in times we hung up on some words so hard that forgot they are entangled to the string that holds you and me as us. And so here we are distant now not even have memories of fun</br>
