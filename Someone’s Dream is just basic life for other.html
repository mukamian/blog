								<p>“Want to earn your livelihoods” he announced</br>
									I knew him, that man in suit now</br>
									He lived and studied with us, work ls in town and I know how</br>
									But a hungry belly didn’t let his respect to fall</br>
									So I went packing for whatever I could and she peeped behind the wall</br>
									But her tears didn’t sock my shoe to wet</br>
									And now I was standing in front of someone’s dream I didn’t have ever thought of yet</br>
									I knew my work and had my tools</br>
									But those people thought like I was a fool</br>
									Today I am lying here and couldn’t feel my head</br>
									A crowd merged before but no one come ahead</br>
									The dreamer appeared from the crowd as a hope</br>
									But his only reaction i saw was nodding in nope</br>
									The tear I left in her eyes was now falling through mine</br>
									And i feel free to say that I shifted thinking the demand of time</br>
									And feed my family not only with food but with pride</br>
									But I think I took a wrong ride</br>
									But I got the respect bit by the Street dogs</br>
									I today don’t have my land or any of my log</br>
									The food I had was stale</br>
									And now when I can’t even feel my self have no one to listen to the tale</br>
									I am the one who worked to build his dream</br>
									I’m here lying still and couldn’t hear my family’s scream</br>
									</p>
