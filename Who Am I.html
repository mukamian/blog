								<p>I know, I know that she stands lonely there</br>
									Should I rush and reach up there</br>
									What they would say, what she will think why I'm here</br>
									Maybe she feel that I'm again trying to show I care</br>
									Now what she is thinking staring to that place</br>
									Why she took that deep breath… is she still in same phase</br>
									Should I go. I should. I will</br>
									Where she going now, she has her smile that I thought was killed</br>
									But her smile doesn’t look the same </br>
									Why I am standing here, I am such a shame</br>
									Okay, </br>
									Now I think is the right moment </br>
									I will wait for her movement</br>
									There she comes... Smiling... But still faded</br>
									What I had to say…  aahh... hmm... "HEY" over here in the shade</br>
									She talks of everything... But still I could feel her in a bay</br>
									GIRL, you can't go there cause I wanted to say...</br>
									ooff!! Waiting... should I go... What would she think if saw me waiting?</br>
									OOoo!! It's time for me to go... this ticking I have started hating</br>
									Finally, she is there.... Girl... Girl... Girl...</br>
									Now walk down " How are you.. After a long time" </br>
									Stop it ask her what you thought</br>
									"hmm" *chuckles*</br>
									Now she will go... Stupid... Think...</br>
									"Okay, what been things"</br>
									Hey... Her eyes... They have a different shine</br>
									No... How can this be... I can't see her like just fine</br></br>
									
									She supposed to be happy</br>
									But how... Who am I...</br>
