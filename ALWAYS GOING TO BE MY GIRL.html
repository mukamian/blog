								<p>Never thought, one day when I would give it up upon you.</br>
									But Still it just a beginning, continue with what lead me to</br>
									Things that happened portraited me in a way I never had been like.</br>
									But can’t say I am not that kind</br>
									Cause If I would not have been, how you thought alike</br>
									Things might get wrong between us and turn to the right</br>
									But you are the only one I could remember with such a bitter memory and I have fights</br>
									You once told me you don’t love me with that hike</br>
									I knew it… I knew it from the day I announced to myself what is it like</br>
									Time went on passing things got more complex,</br>
									Whenever would was like “This is it now, no efforts and let us relax”</br>
									Something or the other happens to lead to the mess</br>
									You told me that you trust me… Really! Then why can’t I could feel it any day Today I confess</br>
									The only day you trusted me was the day before you gave up talking Nevertheless.</br>
									Girl, sometimes feels to show what would have to say</br>
									If you once had, you would know the thing was as swallow as a bay.</br>
									I thought to be friends and that what had to be a test</br>
									Always things I did was say on your face, not like rest</br>
									I know this didn’t make sense to say such things helps me to stay</br>
									Such things are meant to be secret but I say it all cause now it stales</br>
									Thoughts I wrote were with the belief “She won’t get it”</br>
									But the day you read wasn’t the same when I got it corrected</br>
									You… You were you, I don’t want a word.</br>
									The choice I had, either discuss or directly tell you which you always heard</br>
									You may feel I am stupid like you already do</br>
									But let me tell you a truth I could manipulate many situations not related to you</br>
									Even that day your voice was a surprise</br>
									The thought may not be what I wanted but this bond too was a prize</br>
									But this surprise didn’t last for long</br>
									The disappointment was all that prolonged</br>
									Things told may be cheesy or conflict the other claim of mine</br>
									But trust me, it is all what I ever hymn</br>
									I did feel something for you,</br>
									I did try to talk best of the time</br>
									But I remember things I have is few</br>
									I believed in every word you said</br>
									Negativity and let down thoughts were among those I feed</br>
									But all of this ends now.</br>
									It is not just a claim but the last conversation of ours is the reason how.</br>
