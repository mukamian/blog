								<p>No matter what you wish to convey, the words are the only thing that could channel the way but in this race of the words waiting to be told like a hold bay. No one cares of what everyone have to say.
								</br>Things ever told, the words ever said can be drawing into the meaning what anyone wishes to understand. And no one could argue or take a stand. The battle of the words is to be fought by oneself and no matter who wins at last, that distance strands them apart.
								</br>Every word hocked with other. One string pulls them all. Every eye seeks ones perspective and others, fades in haze. Every heart beats for a word of praise, in the fear of getting erased, in hope that the time won’t be the same and dreaming of breaking free from this pace. Stretching their arms, lighting on their feet but still on the ground cause of those chinese whispers in the crowd that grow in a pace breaking their faith.
								</br>“Choose your word wisely” but never had anyone thought of these words too. No one chooses them wrong and one need not to. When their perspective didn’t allowed to imagine thus they fails. They push it hard I do agree but the limit to their thoughts are far of those which were once buried to reach the fiant.
								</br>They think, words are just what we speak and emotions could be deep inside. But when the hand which have been there for every moment before the one they had never thought of, every string that connected them stretch till its last sound, when the way they walked down without noticing around engulf them suffocate, make them notice every detail now as someone was distant to them. When the wardrobe tells them with that known whisper in the ear that it needed to be mented, when the key on the table shouts out loud telling them it was wrong placed that time the only thing one could cuddle around for the peace is the words.
								</br>Never felt that struggle like the words suffocating to touch the oesophagus, desperate to roll round the tongue, to just see the glimpse of what they could cause.
								</br>Beading them into a tangle. Every curve is treated delicately at different angle, but still they come out in a fangle proving themselves and I need them when I wear my clock as an sangle.
