								<p>It has never been so great from so long</br>
									Things were there as something was wrong</br>
									But a sudden ring struck like a kong</br>
									And realized that was my ring song</br>
									The name it displays blushed me up</br>
									I rush to the phone with a bang of my cup</br>
									No thought of what would it be for I greeted</br>
									And got a coolness when that voice treated</br>
									This not been for the first</br>
									But it was as it wasn’t my birthday, so my happiness burst</br>
									And the memories we had started to rust</br>
									And the thought of this meeting of our didn’t let me land on the crust</br>
									Finally, I was there where the familiar voice led me to</br>
									I knew her face but didn’t know I was waiting for who</br>
									Time flew and things were meant to change like a blow</br>
									I was thinking this might turn like meeting someone new</br>
									A hand beside me made me turn</br>
									Things I got in my mind… NO LONGER CONCERN</br>
									Like the time got pause I stared her face</br>
									Still the some in this fast pace</br>
									A smile grew wider as it uses to be</br>
									Girl I thought might turn to strangers is known to me</br>
									They were been called but couldn’t turn up</br>
									And this wasn’t an excuse and she was there to say what’s up</br>
									Some days are like a dream they come and go</br>
									But difference is when you know</br>
									The day you lived brings a smile</br>
									And the other one makes you think for another mile</br>
