								<p>Today he declared that lady as his grandmother in words of his own</br>
									All of sudden, room set with joy rush to him and I sat with thoughts of frown</br>
									The lady wasn’t the one who reminded me that once I have to feed</br>
									She wasn’t the same as my memory had to smile and making me seeds</br>
									“I would tell your kid how you use to behave” she Once told</br>
									Even at high times when I had no sleep</br>
									She would be next to me I had peeped</br>
									Hand on my hand with so much of care</br>
									“You will achieve everything you could think of,” she said and I could hear</br>
									But that day, I still do remember something got things changed</br>
									That day you were on the bed and people set ranged</br>
									I just appeared from the crowd towards her</br>
									I took her head and whispered like she said felt like fur</br>
									My grip was around a finger which touched to cold</br>
									That touch was not the one thing I was losing but still stood bold</br>
									Now his fingers griped around another finger he may feel a care</br>
									But my mom always wanted to hold my son not she wasn’t here</br>
									That lady wasn’t the one who once told me when I wasn’t so grown</br>
									I saw my mom’s face with a smile fading into a hazy on the wall which she once sowed</br>
									My son won’t be ever being able to feel her touch like I felt</br>
									And that lady stared at me with tears in her eyes which she held</br>
									</p>
