								<p>Girl, I know it doesn’t always make sense to you</br>
									But here I am giving it off, and you know exactly for whom</br>
									You are the only one whom I had always been thinking about</br>
									All the time being particular about what I wrote or spoke out</br>
									Friends, you told me we always going to be and that is what we are</br>
									But still, think of this… and tell me Why are we still so far?</br>
									Every time things go wrong I accept, it was always something that I have done</br>
									But never you ever think or even talked about why I did to be the one</br>
									You told me you like to be a mystery</br>
									But every moment I met you I feel I had turned like a history</br>
									Now things went so wrong that we don’t have a topic to talk on</br>
									And all those small things that matter you, had turned upon</br>
									I don’t know why you can say those things to her but can’t turn to me for all</br>
									You once told me I wasn’t the problem and I even felt that it had to solve</br>
									Everything you told me, I had tossed them all</br>
									Every word you told now seemed to turn up lime</br>
									And I know if I asked you… “Everything is fine”</br>
									But why don’t you understand things thought of, are told so that you never hesitate to do the same</br>
									And five years I had admired you and all I left is this shame</br>
									But it is not the first time I told you this</br>
									And I still believe you will misunderstand as things might have gone amiss</br>
									But girl please whatever you think of me say it on my face</br>
									Might be the miscommunication which led our friendship to this phase</br>
									</p>
