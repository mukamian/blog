								<p>There was a conversation with an unread message right there beneath layers of times I just scrolled by without even looking at that thing. Labeled with your name. I remember I said somethings but now, well if they were that important, I would remember. Like I remember when you blamed everything on me, the time when I poured my heart and you just shoved those words down my throat or the time when you just went without turning back and I was left devastated in that crowd or the time when I was been talked down or at least felt like I was. I remember them all. I even saw your hand-colored with henna, the only thing we agreed upon that had a foul smell. That last agreement is gone too. And now I was so sure that conversation would bring nothing but a reminder of what all happened and that pain I been through. </br>
									So, I decided to open it for once. </br>
									Every message I scrolled brought me back down just there, I could feel the heart-pounding and thoughts rushed back, all of them, bringing back how it happened. You girl, walking down the corridors along with you in the morning. Been there with you when you told me things, I thought only I knew. When we walked down to the parking and talked. You coming out with every possible complain right over your head. You chirping around them and me staring at you. Your turn when your friends whispered in your ear. I remember that day when I wanted to tell you that you don’t need the kajal in your eyes. Or the day when I wanted to ask you about the mark near your eye. I remember your smile when you did mischief, I remember your smile when you tried to hide the tears rushing in your eyes, shining them more than usual. I remember your cool answer on my weird question. Even the discussion we had on henna’s smell. All came back, remind how easy it was back then to walk up to you and talk.
									Yes, it wasn’t all good. But it wasn’t all bad too. I wonder how the only thing you once thought you wanted, grew distant. </br>
