								<p>Thought to say it all what matters</br>
									So found a place stood there half an hour before thinking things are going to be better</br>
									She emerges from the crowd</br>
									I felt the shiver in my ground</br>
									But dedicated like a student waiting I stood</br>
									For the result to announce</br>
									Started with a wave, our steps were in sync</br>
									Now was the time I think</br>
									Time went slow, heartbeat went loud</br>
									Pressing it in so that she couldn’t hear a sound</br>
									I had thought of how it would go</br>
									I will say something that she won’t let me go</br>
									Thinking, I thought it would be difficult to explain what I told</br>
									But the real struggle was to utter something that does not sound cold</br>
									But stubborn as a student up on stage, I walked</br>
									For telling the tale I thought all-day</br>
									I collected myself and words managed to come out</br>
									Now when they did there was no world around</br>
									It was effortless which made more sense</br>
									Love was something we feel and thus no judgment from the fence</br>
									Told her the start, cause and reason like any other story</br>
									The tale I told had multiple layers as any other multi-stores</br>
									But still, it was weird cause she didn’t give a look</br>
									and she turned looked and said the most unexpected – “Bye”</br>
									Everything shattered into a reality that it was a dream</br>
