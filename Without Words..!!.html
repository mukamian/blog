								<p>How beautiful the life would be without words?</br>
									No thoughts would on risk of being misunderstood</br>
									No one could hide they were missing you</br>
									No one will judge you or tell you about too high or too low</br>
									No one tells you what to do or where to go</br>
									In this world where no one would speak</br>
									Nothing would allure people to peep</br>
									Everybody would have time to see around</br>
									No one to call and people would see each other through the crowd</br>
									Just to find someone who could understand them well</br>
									Emotions would be easy to see may be inconvenient to tell</br>
									But soon they would learn to express</br>
									The world would no longer be the one to impress</br>
									The compassion and the truth could be judged by eyes</br>
									No tear would fall without being noticed over all the lies</br>
									They would see how they feel when done something insensitive</br>
									They will learn to live with the ones who have their senses</br>
									There would be no one to praise or motivate</br>
									They would know life isnâ€™t about waiting</br>
									No word would have two meaning to interpret</br>
									Nothing would require others mindset to translate</br>
									This is like saying to jump while falling down to the river</br>
									But that is your outlook and your believes what you figure</br>
									</p>
