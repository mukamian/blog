								<p>The day when the morning would begin like the dream</br>
									U would be there sitting beside me</br>
									And we would laugh and smile looking us like this</br>
									That day I would tell u how much u are there in my mind whenever I think…</br>
									The day when u would walk down and stand along</br>
									Nothing would be required and cause would be I am alone there</br>
									Understand what I would be thinking and won’t let a word to say</br>
									That day I would tell u that why I can’t delete u from here</br>
									The day when the pictures of us won’t have spaces</br>
									And your cheek would be touching mine</br>
									Laughter would be spread on our faces</br>
									That day I would tell u that I didn’t ever want to make u cry</br>
									The day when the touches would not be an accident</br>
									And u would be in front of me like a reflection</br>
									That day I would tell u girl your heart is my only destination</br>
									The day when we walk down along each other</br>
									And the hands would be together</br>
									Whose soever walk down, won’t matter</br>
									That day I would tell u that I would hold your hand forever</br>
									The day when u wouldn’t ask to leave</br>
									And we would be together to live</br>
									That day I would show my pain</br>
									But girl remember the pain are the things u never gave</br>
									The day when I would wake up at my time</br>
									When I won’t matter how late was I last night</br>
									The morning would be drenched in the song</br>
									And no one would be there to ask what the thing I like about is</br>
									The day when no scolding for not putting the things at a place that is right</br>
									No one Would say against others as backbiting</br>
									Some day would be surely alike which would make me polite</br>
									And push my all affords to keep everyone smile at a height</br>
									The day when I can learn the same way I like</br>
									No one would be there to disturb</br>
									And no one to say this or that and nor ask why</br>
									The day I would be studying satisfying</br>
									And I believe everyone could feel the happiness in mine</br>
									The day when things would be alright</br>
									And that day I would don’t write</br>
									But enjoy the other restriction</br>
									Which I think is fine</br>
