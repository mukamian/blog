								<p>A day which started as normal as possible, but for you</br>
									Cause for us, this day wasn’t an ordinary neither the one blowing in a boo</br>
									This day, was the relief from the fact that my notebook is still not complete</br>
									Or what was going to happen as I had to get my notebook checked or yesterday’s fleet</br>
									Or all of this and that… today was the relief from the back curving bags we have to carry</br>
									Today was no study day without wishing each other any of merry</br>
									So the day of school started with a weird thing that happens annually</br>
									When I who use to open the class door was welcomed by someone whom I doubted had seen it closed.</br>
									Announced to assemble by the bell which today was ranged manually</br>
									And so pockets skinned around the gadgets we lined for bag checking</br>
									Some caught, some skipped, we headed to the buses with our besties with us...</br>
									Been a fact that all the buses are heading to one direction</br>
									The fight was to have a seat of desire with the whole group or a fraction</br>
									Now set with the people we know around it begun</br>
									Laughing giggling at every light that stops and weaken windows bar where we hung</br>
									Our teachers were staring but this time with a smile</br>
									But we knew their smile hides the word till the new day is while</br>
									So we thought to live in the moment and started to sing loud</br>
									Words chosen with so delicacy, that message is conveyed without been considered out</br>
									With every reduction in voice reduces the concern of teachers along with the rise in voice</br>
									It been hours without them shouting to not to make noise</br>
									We never had a thought of where are we heading to</br>
									Neither we thought from where we began from</br>
									All that mattered now is that journey we had memories of</br>
									</p>
