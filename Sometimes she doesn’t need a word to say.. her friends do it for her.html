								<p>Saw the picture you sent which still lived in my phone</br>
									Now it had been the only evidence that you were by my side might not be alone</br>
									But that memory made me work to keep our friendship in act</br>
									And the moment, no matter how far we go, will be intact</br>
									Now, the serious things had to go from my mind</br>
									I know these are just the feeling from a biased side</br>
									I remember this began with 4 lines in rhymes</br>
									And soon your thought turned into a hymn</br>
									I had never been someone whom you can count upon</br>
									But girl I wish to be the one I told this from long</br>
									But don’t know why… why things I do mess up around</br>
									Might be the reason, my mistake or the people surround</br>
									No matter what be the fact but the distance last from long</br>
									And now the reality is that we just know who haven’t stood together alone</br>
									This has been the things which now resides between us</br>
									The friendship turns up as a hardship and you know it hurts</br>
									But what to say what to explain.. for the thing I heard..??</br>
									Girl my words were the oy thing I own now</br>
									But what he said was again a fact and even resembles you somehow</br>
									Thought to gave up writing</br>
									But that too I had written down</br>
