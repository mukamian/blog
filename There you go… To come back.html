								<p>Staring still and feeling the wave of every word you convey</br>
									Been a long time since we first say ‘Hey’</br>
									And now eyes stared us of all those I would refer as they</br>
									Cause I was somewhere at a time where I knew what next to say</br>
									You with a smile come up to me</br>
									I was at a place where I love to be</br>
									That day you didn’t care of whom-so-ever stood to see</br>
									And your question remained unanswered but you flee</br>
									One of the nods of mine brought to me to the road we stood</br>
									I wish that dream come back as it was and remain as it would</br>
									But your wave distracted to be together</br>
									You have to go you told and turned off rather</br>
									I wanted to shout what I couldn’t tell that day</br>
									I wished the things remain the same out of that bay</br>
									I thought… But the silence remains</br>
									And the screams in mind didn’t give time for words to be frame</br>
									But don’t know the struggle went to your side</br>
									And all the claims you did were the things you lied</br>
									Went off with a tear which you hide</br>
									Not love but you know things never got to be fine</br>
									I won’t have ever known this if I won’t have rushed</br>
									Every complains every demand went off flashed</br>
									Now the time I looked as lonely had someone’s talks to be blushed</br>
									And this time our friendship turned to be two-way hush</br>
									</p>
