								<p>A lot of things which left to say</br>
									Those thought come up while walking down the way</br>
									Wish I could get her here who those are to be conveyed</br>
									As over the time those feeling hadn’t ever fade</br>
									She think everything I do is to get her close</br>
									Now whatever I write have a reflection which do flows</br>
									I never wanted her to know what I felt as may lead to mess</br>
									But, world I could be blamed for this.. may be less</br>
									Wish that day turns back so that I could get that call back</br>
									Flashing her name on screen but that time confidence did lack</br>
									What to say what not to, the thought were in rush</br>
									But her voice was fair enough to make me blush</br>
									Word got struck that time when she had call</br>
									But now I would tell her whatever had actually made me fall</br>
									This time I won’t let my emotions choke</br>
									And why can’t I move on I would have spoke</br>
									And all the feel from very beginning turns into word</br>
									I don’t care and even need them to work</br>
									Just hope that understanding may lead to better as friend</br>
									Never let her go at least from this end</br>
									But irony is in the realization that time had passed</br>
									And no matter what I could do now that moment didn’t last</br>
									</p>
