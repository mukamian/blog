								<p>Stared at a picture of yours till it blurred into the moment, I lived.</br>
								</br>Your golden hair tangled into each other holding every hair except for a stand that now sits on your ear as you made them too.
							</br>Puffed cheeks with a smile that spreads through every feature of your face from nose to eyes to tell that you really feel that happiness. But wait… Your eyes, today they look different. Oh! They have a stroke that really defines them but you don’t need that. I wished I could tell you, you don’t need the one, your eyes define themselves, but uttering a word would lead to a weird awkward. And neither today, I know I don’t have a right to tell what suits you, I never had. But girl believes me I stared you a lot. Those eyes of yours are too much to tell what you are. Your smile you made up never touched them like when you really are smiling. Your every emotion is scribbled in them the way you never wish to put them like. Just as perfect as every greet of your pounds the heart.
						</br>I decided to say before he commented. With the words and thought stirred in little of fear I swallow to be the part of the conversation I knew I wasn’t the part of. I don’t remember where it began or when it ended but the time we shared always felt like worth spent. This lack of conversation mustn’t be confused with the distance but it was more of my absence around her.
