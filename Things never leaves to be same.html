								<p>While seeing the world pacing around</br>
									With the increasing roar of the engine and crowd</br>
									I felt the heart-pounding thinking of where the way would lead</br>
									The stress we carry and the words we thought were now far from the league</br>
									The talkings and laughs in the place, which act as a beats</br>
									A flash from the lane I remember where brought everyone to their feet</br>
									A thing like this which people around haven’t felt for a while</br>
									I remember those shining eyes in which I kept on looking and was later filled</br>
									The laugh I heard was the same as I heard when to daydream ideas cooked</br>
									I remember how a simple cutting made them feel something with which he is hooked between</br>
									How we and our conversation were of different heights</br>
									I remember talking for hours of ones who yet have to call after that fight</br>
									All those initials we called each other from, of whom we once have fallen for</br>
									I remember.. That jerk too which rushed me through 9 years to the faces which waited across</br>
									Seen them wasn’t different but bit peculiar as remember them all,</br>
									Looking at each other remember how we looked underneath that hall</br>
									Thinking how he uses to laugh and say things, and all those memories we got</br>
									The brother with short height and in touch was now a boss in a firm grip</br>
									The boy with a beating heart had a girl next to him, holding like no wag to slip</br>
									The one with fats hanging off his belt had a built</br>
									The one with the real sense but never been serious, she now had attitude hilt</br>
									The one who wasn’t confident now had command over what he spoke</br>
									The one with the name of a cartoon character was no longer a part of different flock</br>
									The one with the sweet smile had dark circles taking over</br>
									What I once thought and what I remember were in the past now</br>
									All we know is that’s the time we have no matter how</br>
									So we did what we are best at</br>
									Brought all of the memories around the bonfire and there we sat</br>
									</p>
