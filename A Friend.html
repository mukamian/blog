								<p>Into the crowd of the strangers</br>
									I stood finding my way through the talls</br>
									I knew where the path would lead me to</br>
									But I rised on my toes to see though all</br>
									I wished I could see a face I knew</br>
									But my wishing was just a bluff like other few</br>
									I remember walking through the fair with all the eyes on me</br>
									All the activities stood still followed by “Whee”</br>
									They knew each other and I was held with my insecurities</br>
									I was new in the room and that raised their curiosity</br>
									A eyes with a question followed me through my way</br>
									I with a puff of confidence smiled with hey</br>
									A timid but firm smile crossed through the bay</br>
									And I knew it was a bringing a ray</br>
									Sharing food had a slight misconception</br>
									And we used to exchange them with my own selection</br>
									Talk and live long each other and didn’t knew of getting bored</br>
									And with him was first I went to the other side of corridor</br>
									With increase in comfort followed alongness</br>
									But Separated by the walls of A and C now more of loneliness And in the pace of life we learned to move on</br>
									We had some more friend than last time we were along</br>
									But now our old friendship reached the horizon</br>
									And the bond we shared again risen</br>
									Since then we are along</br>
									Ever turned back for this long</br>
									But dude now again you and I had this distance</br>
									And the point of this is to remind you of the instance</br>
									See I knew I don’t picked up your call on time</br>
									But what I would do now when I have need you to remind</br>
									Dude you have always been with a story and a lesson</br>
									ANd so long distance now can’t it be lesser</br>
									I know that it was important but what to do</br>
									You only care of the people when they are not next to you</br>
									But in the hope of meeting you soon</br>
									I won’t even say you good bye</br>
									Always remember I need you and YOU ALWAYS BEEN A BOON</br>
									</p>
