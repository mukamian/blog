								<p>All of the time, with the wind hitting to my face</br>
									I hoped to see the girl I left, in this pace</br>
									Thinking of the corridors we rushed together in</br>
									The time we stood next to each other looking keen</br>
									I remember, I wasn’t the best friend but show she was</br>
									I mess things and feeling but she sorted those raw</br>
									With thoughts in my mind and different ways to start</br>
									As I was walking in, every plan and line left me apart</br>
									And I was peculiar about the chills since I left the car</br>
									Like I waited for years… I knew that an old scar</br>
									Containing myself back to the moment I am in</br>
									But mind still struck in the time in which you and I, we been</br>
									You, with your eyes on the clock, ring between the fingers</br>
									Waiting, in that Iris fringer</br>
									I walked down and you heard the foot approaching</br>
									Smile, I saw it after such a long time</br>
									Once again an old scar… Approached</br>
									Looked in the deepest of eyes of other</br>
									Trying to remember how we use to look</br>
									And all the thought overcame by one</br>
									What all the messing up things have taken?</br>
									Some fumbling words struggled to break the silence</br>
									And the predefined conversation was the only reliance</br>
									But soon the sequence approached to its limit</br>
									Leaving us looking around appeared to find our ways with it</br>
									And here they enter in some sort of rush</br>
									The whole silence thing been somewhere in hush</br>
									Chuckled and talks followed them around</br>
									I too was laughing rolling on the ground</br>
									Saw her eyes rising in interrogation</br>
									I did want to answer and indulge in negotiation</br>
									But I guess she too forgot what she thought to ask</br>
									And so here we are..</br>
