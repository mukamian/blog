								<p>With all my regards to ma’am my eyes turned heavy with every topic she taught</br>
									I had interest so decided to feel every topic as studying was what I ought</br>
									Soon all unrecognized voices faded but I still heard a crowd</br>
									Distracted from the topic, with all queries I felt the disbelieve when I figured it out</br>
									Similar faces whom I once said good bye someday long were back around</br>
									Nothing had changed the condition, neither had aged what surrounds</br>
									With a surprise like I just woke up from a long dream I walked around like sane</br>
									Noticing, feeling everything I remember once thought won’t be able to see again</br>
									The undecorated soft board, green board with date T.S., P.S., A.S., and the topic explained</br>
									The lost windowpanes, duster, those dismantled desks with different name on plain</br>
									A group in the corner whose chuckles echoes the room</br>
									A group at first in first row discussing of who said to whom</br>
									Those boys in last of the mid row where in some deep thoughts</br>
									But I, I just walk down to the desk I remember as mine, no notice I got</br>
									And I saw a mirror, the reflection was more alive and laughing with the guys near</br>
									I remember them, not just by name but those guys I know as someone who always care</br>
									Laughing listening to the jokes I could predict would end like but still no one sensed I’m there</br>
									Seeing the desk top painted with lyrics of all the songs I knew we would sing here</br>
									Then when the reflection of mine walked by I was so sure where it was heading to</br>
									So I walked down in that lonely corridor leading to the places I been before to</br>
									But soon a touch at shoulder blurred that corridor and light come through a half</br>
									I opened my eyes, hearing them giggling and laugh</br>
									But ma’am stood still and her eyes raised with query of my dosing</br>
									And the floor grew rough as I kept on stare might be causing</br>
									The minute hand swung and turned to be a savior</br>
									The voice that faded reminded me that was a bad behavior</br>
									The people around had different laugh, no soft board neither the seat I draw as mine</br>
									That was the time I have been living in so realized to be fine</br>
									</p>
